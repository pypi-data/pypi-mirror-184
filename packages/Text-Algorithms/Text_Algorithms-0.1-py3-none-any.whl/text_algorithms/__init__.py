def manachers(text: str) -> None:
    """

    A function that find the longest palindrome substring of a given text
    using the Manacher's improvements so that we don't have to check each
    character as center.With those improvements we can find the longest
    palindrome substring in linear time O(n).
    There are 4 cases that we check.

    Case 1:
    longest_palindrome_substring[currentRightPosition] = longest_palindrome_substring[i_mirror]
    when
    1)i-left palindrome contained inside the center palindrome,
    2)i-left palindrome is not a prefix of center palindrome.
    That happens when longest_palindrome_substring[i_mirror] < centerRightPosition - currentRightPosition

    Case 2:
    longest_palindrome_substring[currentRightPosition] = longest_palindrome_substring[i_mirror]
    when
    1)i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome,
    2)center palindrome is suffix of input text.
    That happen when longest_palindrome_substring[currentLeftPosition] = centerRightPosition - currentRightPosition

    Case 3:
    longest_palindrome_substring[currentRightPosition] >= longest_palindrome_substring[i_mirror]
    when
    1)i-left palindrome is prefix of center palindrome,
    2)center palindrome is not a suffix of input text.
    That happens when L[i_mirror] = centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition (For 1st condition) AND
    centerRightPosition < 2 * n where n is input string length n (For 2nd condition).
    In that case there is a possibility for expansion of i-right palindrome and the length of i-right palindrome
    will be at least equal or bigger than length of i-left palindrome.

    Case 4:
    longest_palindrome_substring[currentRightPosition] >= longest_palindrome_substring[i_mirror]
    when
    i-left palindrome is not contained whole in center palindrome.
    That happens when L[i_mirror] > centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition.

    We change centerPosition into currentRightPosition if palindrome centered in currentRightPosition
    expands beyond centerRightPosition.
    In this case, length of i-right palindrome is at least as long (centerRightPosition – currentRightPosition) and
    there is a possibility of i-right palindrome expansion.
