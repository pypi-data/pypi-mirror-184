# ReversingLabsSDK

A Python SDK for ReversingLabs REST services (TitaniumCloud and appliances) - Python 3 version.

The idea behind this SDK is to enable easier out-of-the-box development of software integrations and automation services that need to interact with ReversingLabs.

The SDK consists of several modules, where each module represents one ReversingLabs service or ReversingLabs TitaniumCloud.

def __init__(self, host, token, wait_time_seconds=2, retries=10, verify=True, proxies=None, user_agent=DEFAULT_USER_AGENT)
```
#### Parameters:
`host` - TitaniumScale address  
`token` - A1000 user token for the REST API  
`wait_time_seconds` - wait time between each report fetching retry  
`retries` - number of report fetching retries  
`verify` - verify SSL certificate
