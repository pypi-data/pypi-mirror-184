This factory is prone to significant key errors unless you are sure of the snakecase names of all possible submitted type names. SourceFactory avoids this problem by allowing you to declare corresponding types and string names.\n\n## Validators\n\n\n<p align="center">\n<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/emN3Lsx8elioidwcLS/giphy.gif" height="300"/>\n</p>\n\n\n* `bonafide`: decorator that validates or converts types based on type annotations of the wrapped function or dataclass (under construction)\n* \nashford`s framework supports a wide range of coding styles. You can create complex multiple inheritance structures with mixins galore or simpler, compositional objects. Even though the data structures are necessarily object-oriented, all of the tools to modify them are also available as functions, for those who prefer a more funcitonal approaching to programming. \n\nThe project is also highly internally documented so that users and developers can easily make ashford work with their projects. It is designed for Python coders at all levels. Beginners should be able to follow the readable code and internal documentation to understand how it works. More advanced users should find complex and tricky problems addressed through efficient code.',
