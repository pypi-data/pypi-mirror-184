# Smart Capture

Edge devices such as vehicles, drones or robots are resource constrained and donâ€™t have sufficient storage or network bandwidth to store or stream all captured data. As a result, valuable edge case data is lost making it hard to improve their model performance.

To address this, Smart Capture enables ML teams to intelligently capture the most valuable data from their edge devices to improve their models.

## Installation

`$ pip install scale-smartcapture`
