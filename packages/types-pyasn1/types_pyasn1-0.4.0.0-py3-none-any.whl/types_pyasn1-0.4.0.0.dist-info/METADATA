## Typing stubs for pyasn1

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pyasn1` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `pyasn1`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyasn1. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `b5048a00e650d86658d09c0e1dc00f82c601b19b`.
