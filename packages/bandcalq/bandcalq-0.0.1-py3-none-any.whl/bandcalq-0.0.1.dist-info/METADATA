# BandCalQ
**BandCalQ** is a Qiskit library created for band theory calculations using variational quantum algorithms. This framework's goal is to deliver a simple interface that allows users to acquire electronic band structures providing minimal input. 

## Installation
BandCalQ can be installed via ``pip`` using the following command.
```bash
pip install bandcalq
```
All dependencies are handled automatically.
## Usage
Usage of the BandCalQ library is explained in provided Jupyter Notebooks - ``example_simple.ipynb`` and ``example_advanced.ipynb`` that can be found in examples directory.
