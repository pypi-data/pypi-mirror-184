Install
=======

(Recommended) With `pipx <https://pypi.org/project/pipx/>`_::

    pipx install paul-mclendahand

With pip from PyPI::

    pip install paul-mclendahand
    
With pip from GitHub main branch::

    pip install https://github.com/willkg/paul-mclendahand/archive/main.zip

With pip from a clone of the repository with dev dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    
Quick start
===========

Configure pmac
--------------

pmac needs to know the GitHub user and GitHub project.

You can set configuration in the ``setup.cfg`` file::

   [tool:paul-mclendahand]
   github_user=user
   github_project=project
   main_branch=git-main-branch-name

You can override the ``setup.cfg`` variables with environment variables::

   PMAC_GITHUB_USER=user
   PMAC_GITHUB_PROJECT=project
   PMAC_MAIN_BRANCH=git-main-branch-name

**Optional**

You can also use a GitHub personal access token. You set it in the
``PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`` environment variable.

For example::

    PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=abcdef0000000000000000000000000000000000 pmac listprs

.. Note::

   If you find pmac stops working because it's getting rate-limited by GitHub,
   you should use a personal access token.


Using pmac
----------

After you've configured git, then you can use ``pmac`` like this:

1. Create a new branch::

       git checkout <MAIN-BRANCH>
       git checkout -b update-prs

2. List open PRs::

       pmac listprs

3. Combine some pull requests into it::

       pmac add 5100 5101 5102

   Use the same pull requests numbers as on GitHub.

   Internally, ``pmac`` uses ``git am`` to apply commits from pull requests. If
   you hit a ``git am`` conflict, ``pmac`` will tell you. You can edit the file
   in another terminal to manually resolve the conflict. Then do::

       git add FILE
       git commit
       git am --continue

   After that, you can continue with ``pmac``.

4. When you're done, push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request.

   ``pmac`` can help with the PR description::

       pmac prmsg


pmac
----

.. [[[cog
    from paul_mclendahand.cmd_pmac import pmac_cli
    from click.testing import CliRunner
    result = CliRunner().invoke(pmac_cli, ["--help"])
    cog.out("\n")
    cog.out("::\n\n")
    for line in result.output.splitlines():
        if line.strip():
            cog.out(f"   {line}\n")
        else:
            cog.out("\n")
    cog.out("\n")
   ]]]

::

   Usage: pmac [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

     GitHub pull request combiner tool.

     pmac uses a "[tool:paul-mclendahand]" section in setup.cfg to set
     configuration variables. You can override these using PMAC_VARNAME environment
     variables.

     Additionally, if you want to use a GitHub personal access token, you need to
     provide the "PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN" variable in the environment set to the
     token.

Why does this project exist?
============================

Two main reasons.

First, GitHub doesn't support combining pull requests. There is a forum post
about it here:
https://github.community/t/feature-request-combine-pull-requests/2250

Second, dependabot (also owned by GitHub) doesn't support grouping dependency
updates into a single pull request. If you have 50 dependency updates, it
creates 50 pull requests (sometimes more!). I have a lot of projects and lack
of grouping updates makes monthly maintenance miserable. There's an issue for
this:
https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1190


History
=======

3.0.0 (January 4th, 2023)
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

* Add support for Python 3.11. (#32)

* Add ``--labels`` flag to ``listprs`` to show pull request labels. (#29)


OTHER THINGS:

* Rewrote command line interface using `click
  <https://pypi.org/project/click/>`__ and `rich
  <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`__. Output is a lot nicer. Instructions for
  handling conflicts when combining PRs are clearer. (#36)

* Add command-line help to README. (#35)


2.1.0 (February 7th, 2022)
--------------------------

OTHER THINGS:

* Better handling for ``git am`` conflicts. (#22)

* Better handling for when no changes were applied. ``pmac add`` won't adjust
  the top-most commit. (#24)


2.0.0 (July 15th, 2021)
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES:

* Rewrote how ``pmac add`` works. It no longer needs you to edit your
  ``.git/config`` file. It now uses the GitHub API to fetch the commits for the
  PRs being added.

  You can remove ``git_remote`` related configuration. It's no longer used.

  You should use GitHub to create an API token and then use that as the value
  for the ``PMAC_GITHUB_API_TOKEN``. This will fix issues with rate-limiting.

  (#14)

OTHER THINGS:

* Switched to a ``src/`` based project layout and moved requirements into
  ``setup.py`` file.


1.2.0 (June 12th, 2020)
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES:

* Added a ``PMAC_MAIN_BRANCH`` environment variable and ``main_branch`` configuration
  option which specify the name of the main branch. (#12)


1.1.0 (April 7th, 2020)
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES:

* Added a ``--git_remote`` argument, ``PMAC_GIT_REMOTE`` environment variable,
  and ``git_remote`` configuration option which, when specified, will cause
  pmac to use that as the remote name and not guess. (#10)


OTHER THINGS:

* Added a Makefile because that's how I roll.

* Tweaked ``pmac --help`` so it shows the version and release date and link to
  issue tracker.

* Cleaned up README.

* Made a peanut butter pie and ate it.


1.0.0 (January 14, 2020)
------------------------

* Initial writing.
