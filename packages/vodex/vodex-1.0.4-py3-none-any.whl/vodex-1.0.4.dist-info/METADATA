# vodex : Volumetric Data and Experiment manager
Vodex is a Python library for dealing with volumetric movies , written as a sequence of slices and split across multiple tif files.
It will keep track of full volumes / particular z-slices, making it easy to do requests like " give me all z slices # 23 in the whole movie" , or " give me volumes # 6, 85 and 54 ", regardless of whether these volumes are split between multiple tif files, or not. It can also link particular experimental conditions to certain volumes/slices, making it easy to request something like " give me all full volumes when I was shining the green light " or " give me all slices # 16 after we have administered the drug ".
