"""
This module contains classes to load and collect information from the imaging data.

The module contains the following classes:

- `TiffLoader` - A class to work with tiff image files.
It is used to get the datatype of the images, get the number of frames in each tiff file and load frames from tiff files.
You can create your own loaders to work with other file types.

- `ImageLoader` - Chooses appropriate loader based on the type of the imaging files,
collects information about the datatype, number of frames per file and loads data from files.
