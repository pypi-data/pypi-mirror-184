Description: # Welcome to the commit message generator!
        
        This script allows you to generate a summary of commit messages made by you in the specified number of days, organized by date and repository.
        
        ## How to use
        
        To use this script, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You will also need to have git configured with your username.
        
        To run the script, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, run the following command:
        
        ```python commit_message_generator.py [days]```
        
        
        Replace `[days]` with the number of days you want to filter the commit messages by. For example, to get a summary of commit messages made by you in the past 7 days, you would run:
        
        ```python commit_message_generator.py 7```
        
        
        The script will then generate a text file called `commit_messages.txt` in an `output` directory, which will contain the commit messages organized by date and repository.
        
        ## Additional features
        
        The script also allows you to specify the time range for the commit messages using the `--since` flag. For example, to get a summary of commit messages made by you in the past month, you could run:
        
        ```python commit_message_generator.py --since='1 month ago'```
        
        
        ## Notes
        
        - The script will only consider commit messages made by the user who is currently logged in to git.
        - The script will only consider commit messages made on branches, not tags.
        
        We hope you find this script helpful in organizing and summarizing your commit messages!
