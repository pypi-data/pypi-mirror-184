## 1.2.0 Chinilla blockchain 2022-7-26

### Notes

This release aligns with Chia 1.5.0

### Added

- Added derivation index information to the Wallet UI to show the current derivation index height
- Added section in Settings to allow the user to manually update the derivation index height in order to ensure the wallet finds all the coins
- Added a tooltip for users to understand why their CAT balance has changed as new CAT2 tokens get re-issued
- There is now a `blockchain_wallet_v2_r1_*.sqlite` DB that will be created, which will sync from 0 to look for CAT2 tokens. This preserves a copy of your previous wallet DB so that you are able to look up previous transactions by using an older wallet client
- Extended `min_coin` to RPC calls, and CLI for coin selection
- Show DID in the offer preview for NFTs
- Added wallet RPCs (`get_derivation_index`, `update_derivation_index`) to enable the GUI, and CLI to report what the current derivation index is for scanning wallet addresses, and also allows a user to move that index forward to broaden the set of addresses to scan for coins

### Changed

- Changed the DID Wallet to use the new coin selection algorithm that the Standard Wallet, and the CAT Wallet already use
- Changed returning the result of send_transaction to happen after the transaction has been added to the queue, rather than it just being added to the mempool.
- Increased the priority of wallet transactions vs full node broadcasted transactions, so we don't have to wait in line as a wallet user
- Deprecated the `-st, --series-total` and `-sn, --series-number` RPC and CLI NFT minting options in favor of `-ec, --edition-count` and `-en, --edition-number` to align with NFT industry terms
- When creating a DID profile, a DID-linked NFT wallet is automatically created
- Update `chinilla wallet take_offer` to show NFT royalties that will be paid out when an offer is taken
- Added a parameter to indicate how many additional puzzle hashes `create_more_puzzle_hashes` should create

### Fixed

- Fixed [CVE-2022-36447] where in tokens previously minted on the Chinilla blockchain using the `CAT1` standard can be inflated in arbitrary amounts by any holder of the token. Total amount of the token can be increased as high as the malicious actor pleases. This is true for every `CAT1` on the Chinilla blockchain, regardless of issuance rules. This attack is auditable on-chain, so maliciously altered coins can potentially be "marked" by off-chain observers as malicious.
- Fixed issue that prevented websockets from being attempted if an earlier websocket failed
- Fixed issue where `test_smallest_coin_over_amount` did not work properly when all coins were smaller than the amount
- Fixed a performance issue with knapsack that caused it to keep searching for more coins than could actually be selected. Performance with 200k coins:
  - Old: 60 seconds
  - New: 0.78 seconds
- Fixed offer compression backwards compatibility
- Fixed royalty percentage check for NFT0 NFTs, and made the check for an offer containing an NFT more generalized
- Fixed timing with asyncio context switching that could prevent networking layer from responding to ping

## 1.0.4 Chinilla Blockchain 2022-05-02

### Added

- Added support for sharing offers to the Chinilla.com Offer Trader from the GUI.

### Added

- Added The first two Chinilla Asset Tokens to the GUI:

  *  `Founder Token`: The first 100 farmers who won a block will receive ONE (1) by April 27, 2022
  *  `Early Farmer Token`: Every farmer who received a block reward in the first 100,000 blocks will receive FIVE (5) by April 27, 2022

### Fixed

- redirected `taildatabase.com` links to `Chinilla.com`


## 1.0.2 Chinilla Blockchain 2022-04-20

### Notes

- This release aligns with Chia 1.3.4

### Added

- Creating an offer now allows you to edit the exchange between two tokens that will auto calculate either the sending token amount or the receiving token amount
- When making an offer, makers can now create an offer including a fee to help get the transaction into the mempool when an offer is accepted
- Implemented `chinilla rpc` command
- New RPC `get_coin_records_by_hint` - Get coins for a given hint (Thanks @freddiecoleman)
- Add maker fee to remaining offer RPCs
- Add healthcheck endpoint to rpc services
- Optional wallet type parameter for `get_wallets` and `wallet show`
- Add `select_coins` RPC method by (Thanks @ftruzzi)
- Added `-n`/`--new-address` option to `chinilla wallet get_address`
- New DBWrapper supporting concurrent readers
- Added `config.yaml` option to run the `full_node` in single-threaded mode
- Build cli only version of debs
- Add `/get_stray_cats` API for accessing unknown CATs

### Changed

- Left navigation bar in the GUI has been reorganized and icons have been updated
- Settings has been moved to the new left hand nav bar
- Token selection has been changed to a permanent column in the GUI instead of the drop down list along
- Manage token option has been added at the bottom of the Token column to all users to show/hide token wallets
- Users can show/hide token wallets. If you have auto-discover cats in config.yaml turned off, new tokens will still show up there, but those wallets wonâ€™t get created until the token has been toggled on for the first time
- CATs now have a link to Chinilla.com token database to look up the Asset ID
- Ongoing improvements to the internal test framework for speed and reliability.
- Significant harvester protocol update: You will need to update your farmer and all your harvesters as this is a breaking change in the harvester protocol. The new protocol solves many scaling issues. In particular, the protocol supports sending delta changes to the farmer - so for example, adding plots to a farm results in only the new plots being reported. We recommend you update your farmer first.
- Updated clvm_tools to 0.4.4
- Updated clvm_tools_rs to 0.1.7
- Changed code to use by default the Rust implementation of clvm_tools (clvm_tools_rs)
- Consolidated socket library to aiohttp and removed websockets dependency
- During node startup, missing blocks in the DB will throw an exception
- Updated cryptography to 36.0.2
- The rust implementation of CLVM is now called `chia_rs` instead of `clvm_rs`.
- Updated code to use improved rust interface `run_generator2`
- Code improvements to prefer connecting to a local trusted node over untrusted nodes

### Fixed

- Harvester: Reuse legacy refresh interval if new params aren't available
- Fixed typos `lastest` > `latest` (Thanks @daverof)

- Improved handling of chain reorgs with atomic rollback for the wallet
- Handled cases where one node doesn't have the coin we are looking for
- Fixed timelord installation for Debian

### Notes

- This release contains some minor fixes and adjustments that were noted during the launch.

### Changed

- fixed spelling error in `english.txt` file
- updated chinilla explorer links


## 1.0.0 Chinilla Blockchain 2022-04-06

### Notes

- Due to a side-chain attack on the initial launch and the difficulty also being too low we have changed the ports and are relaunching fresh with 1.0.0 again.
- Somehow the Chia certs also ended up in the final release which was not intended.
- This is the inital release of the Chinilla blockchain.
- This release is aligned with Chia version 1.3.3
- Uses port 43444

### Changed

-  `vanillanet` is now `vanillanet`
