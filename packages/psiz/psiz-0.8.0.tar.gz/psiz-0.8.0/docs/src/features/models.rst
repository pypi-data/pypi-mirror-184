In PsiZ, a model can be thought as having two major components. The first component is a psychological embedding which describes how the agent of interest perceives similarity between a set of stimuli. This component includes a conventional embedding (representing the stimuli coordinates in psychological space) and a kernel that defines how similarity is computed between the embedding coordinates. The second component describes how similarities are converted into an observed behavior, such as rankings or ratings.
