# pydra-bids

Pydra tasks for BIDS I/O.

[Pydra] is a dataflow engine which provides a set of lightweight abstractions
for DAG construction, manipulation, and distributed execution.

[BIDS] defines standards for organizing neuroimaging files and metadata.

This project provides tasks for reading from and writing to BIDS datasets.
