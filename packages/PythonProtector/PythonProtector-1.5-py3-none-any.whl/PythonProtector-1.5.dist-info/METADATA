## 1.0 - 2022-09-18

Release Initial Project

## 1.1 - 2022-12-28

So It's been kind of a while since we released a new update, I had some pretty big stuff going on irl, no time to code, just recently came back and decided to make some updates.

- Completely Configurable Module System - Users now have the choice of deciding what modules they use, currently there are only the main 4 me and marci provide, but we are open to pull requests and we will be adding more in the future, do check the repository or the example for more information.

- `should_exit` argument - gives users the ability to decide if the program should exit if one of the detections were raised.

- Overall Improvement/Refactoring - This update didn't bring everything me and marci are planning for, but this is just a couple, in the update I made to sure to cover some edge cases so you guys don't get confused

## 1.5 - 2022-01-05
