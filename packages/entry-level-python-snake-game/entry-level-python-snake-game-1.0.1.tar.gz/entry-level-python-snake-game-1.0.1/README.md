# Entry level Python Snake Game

### Resume
This is small game was created to pratice my python skills and make a fun game.

## Libraries
To built it was used some simples built-in lib as *keyboard*, *threading*, *time*, *random*
and at least an external lib named *curses* to manipulate *prompt* screen. 

## The Idea
The first idea for the project was to create a snake game that was possible to
catch the rabbit at the same time that you needed to run from an eagle.
Furthermore, you would have skills to increase the chance to run that eagle as throwing poison
and etc...
At first was just programmed to rabbit runs and the remains is a normal snake game.
