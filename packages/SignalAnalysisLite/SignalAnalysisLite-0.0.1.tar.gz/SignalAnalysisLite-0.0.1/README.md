# Welcome to Signal Analysis Lite

Signal Analysis Lite is a collection of functions that I have personally used to analyze various data sets. While not complete, it represents a dynamic package which I will be continuously improving. Any and all suggestions are welcome.

### Package installations

Under 'SignalAnalysisLite' directory:

1). Make sure the system requirements are up to date by running: 
		pip install -r requirements.txt
