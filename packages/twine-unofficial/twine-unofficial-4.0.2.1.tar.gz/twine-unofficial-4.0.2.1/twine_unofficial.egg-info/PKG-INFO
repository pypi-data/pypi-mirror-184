twine-unofficial
================

This is a fork of the `official twine`_ project, with the following
changes:

- Upload command now supports ``--skip-tls-check`` option to disable
  TLS certificate verification. This is useful for uploading to
  repositories with self-signed certificates.

  Closed issue: `#463 <https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/463>`_,
  rejected PR: `#387 <https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/387>`_.

- Upload ``--skip-existing`` option now support pre-upload check
  against non-default PyPI repositories.

  Similar issue: `#919 <https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues/919>`_

- Upload command support ``--fail-on-existing`` option to fail if
  the package already exists on the repository.
  This is useful for avoid overwriting existing packages, even
  if PyPI is configured to allow overwriting.

Installation
------------

.. code:: shell

   $ pip install twine-unofficial

Versioning
----------

Fork versioning is based on the official version, with the following
format: ``{official-version}.{fork-version}``.

Twine is a utility for `publishing`_ Python packages on `PyPI`_.

It provides build system independent uploads of source and binary
`distribution artifacts <distributions_>`_ for both new and existing
`projects`_.

See our `documentation`_ for a description of features, installation
and usage instructions, and links to additional resources.

Contributing

See our `developer documentation`_ for how to get started, an
architectural overview, and our future development plans.
