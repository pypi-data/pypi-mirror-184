# Python Tools for NIfTI-MRS
## WARNING - THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION CODE.
This package contains python-based tools for representing, validating, and manipulating the NIfTI-MRS format. [NIfTI-MRS]() is a standardised format for storing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy data. 

These tools are used extensively in the [spec2nii]() conversion program and the [FSL-MRS](fsl-mrs.com) analysis software. However, this library can also be used as a stand-alone set of tools.

## Installation
TODO - conda, pip

## Contributing and tests
Contributions via pull requests are very welcome. Please take time to develop tests to continually validate new features or changes.
