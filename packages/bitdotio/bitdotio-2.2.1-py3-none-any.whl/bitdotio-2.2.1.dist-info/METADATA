# bit.io Python SDK & Command Line Tool

## Installation

In order to support different environments, we have a few ways to install the bitdotio
package with or without the `psycopg2` dependency.

1. If you already have `psycopg2` installed, you can install the default bitdotio package:
```
pip install bitdotio
```

2. If you already have Postgres installed, you can install with the psycopg2 dependency:
```
pip install 'bitdotio[psycopg2]'
```

3. If you do not have or cannot install Postgres, you can install with the psycopg2-binary dependency:
```
pip install 'bitdotio[psycopg2-binary]'
```

## Versioning

`python-bitdotio` uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

# `bitdotio` module

## Usage

The `bitdotio` module consists of a `bitdotio` SDK object which provides helpful
utilities for creating and managing pre-configured connections to bit.io databases
via `psycopg2`, as well as easy methods for accessing the functionality exposed by the
[bit.io developer API](https://docs.bit.io/reference)

Once you have `bitdotio` installed all you need is your API key to start working with bit.io.

You can get your API key by logging into bit.io and opening [the "Connect" tab](https://docs.bit.io/docs/your-connection-credentials) on a database page.

### Example usage

See API reference at the bottom of this document for a full list of methods provided by
the SDK.

```python
import os
import time

from bitdotio import bitdotio


# Load bit.io API key from environment variable
BITIO_KEY = os.environ.get("BITIO_KEY")

# Instantiate the bit.io SDK object
b = bitdotio(BITIO_KEY)

# Create a new public database on bit.io
db_metadata = b.create_database("my-db", is_private=False)
db_name = db_metadata["name"]

# Use a pooled cursor to insert some data
with b.pooled_cursor(db_name) as cur:
    cur.execute("CREATE TABLE person (name text, age integer);")
    people = [("Alice", 45), ("Bob", 84), ("Catherine", 19), ("Davis", 22), ("Emily", 34)]
    for name, age in people:
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO person (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)", (name, age))

# Execute a query via the HTTP API
print(b.query(db_name, "SELECT * FROM person", data_format="objects"))

# Create a new table "city" by importing a file.
with open("city.csv", "rb") as f:
    job_status = b.create_import_job("my-username/my-db", "city", file=f)
    # Poll the status of the job until done
    while True:
        job_status = b.get_import_job(job_status["id"])
        if job_status["state"] == "DONE":
            break
        if job_status["state"] == "FAILED":
            # If the import failed for whatever reason, raise an exception with the
            # error info.
            error_id = job_status["error_id"]
            error_type = job_status["error_type"]
            error_details = job_status["error_details"]
            raise Exception(
                f"Import failed. error_id={error_id} error_type={error_type}, error_details={error_details}"
            )

        # Wait a little before trying again
        time.sleep(0.2)
```

### Making queries

#### Connecting directly

The `bitdotio` SDK object provides the methods `pooled_connection`, `pooled_cursor`, and
`get_connection` for connecting directly to your database (see below for discusson on
when to use each of these). The connections/cursors returned by these methods are
`psycopg2` connections and cursors, which are fully compatible with the
[Python DB-API](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/). Full documentation on `psycopg2` can
be found [here](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html.).

It is preferable to use direct connections in the majority of cases, since they have
superior performance and enable more features compared to the `query` method. In
particular we strongly recommend using direct connections in programs that are
long-running, require transaction management, or transfer large quantities of data.

#### The `query` method

The `query` runs queries via the bit.io HTTP API, and therefore will have worse
performance and feature support than direct connections. Importantly, each query run
via the `query` method is run in a single transaction. The `query` method is recommended
in situations where installing a database driver is undesirable or impossible, when
queries are being run very infrequently, or in very short-lived contexts such as one-off
scripts or serverless backends.

### Connection pooling and management

The recommended way to obtain a direct connection to a bit.io database is via a
connection pool. In order to support scaling to zero, bit.io automatically closes idle
connections after a period of time, and puts databases into a dormant state when there
are no live connections. If you are designing a long-running application, you should
make sure that your database access pattern is resilient to connection closures and
database shutdowns. The best way to do this is via a connection pool. Acquiring
connections from a connection pool allows connection re-use, and handles reconnects in
the event that a connection is dropped. The `bitdotio` SDK object internally manages a
thread-safe connection pool per-database that the caller connects to, and provides two
helpful context mangers for acquiring connections from a pool:
- `pooled_connection`: A context manager providing a `psycopg2` connection to the
  given database acquired from a connection pool. When exiting the context created by
  this context manager, the connection is returned to the pool if still open, or
  discarded if closed. It is recommended to use this method when executing multiple
  transacions, or in situations where explicit transaction management is required.
- `pooled_cursor`: A context manager providing a `psycopg2` cursor created from a
  connection acquired from a connection pool. When exiting the context created by this
  context manager, the cursor's tansaction will be committed, and its connection will be
  returned to the connection pool. It is recommended to use this method in situations
  where a single transaction is required without any complex handling logic. For
  example, performing a sequence of `SELECT` queries, or performing a single insertion
  or update.

There may be situations in which a self-managed, unpooled connection is needed. For
example, if the client needs to persist state onto the connection's database session using
the `SET` command. For such situations, the SDK object provides the `get_connection`
method.

For more information on all of the above, refer to the `psycopg2` documentation on
[connections](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/connection.html),
[cursors](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/cursor.html),
and [pools](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/pool.html).

### Data imports and exports

The `bitdotio` SDK object provides helper methods to facilitate importing and exporting
data from your bit.io database.

To import data into a table on your bit.io database from a file locally or on the web
you can use the `create_import_job` method. To export data from a query or a table in
your bit.io database you can use the `create_export_job` method.

These methods have somewhat symmetrical workflows in that they both kick off jobs on
the bit.io backend which execute asynchronously, and have companion methods
(`get_import_job`, and `get_export_job`) to check on the status of a running job.

At a high level, the procedure for doing a data import looks like:
1. Call `create_import_job` and get back the job status
2. Use the job status info to poll `get_import_job` until the job status is reported
   as `DONE` or `FAILED`
3. If `DONE`, the data has been successfully imported and your table is ready to query
4. If `FAILED`, the job status object will contain metadata describing what went wrong.

Similarly, a data export looks like:
1. Call `create_export_job` and get back the job status
2. Use the job status info to poll `get_export_job` until the job status is reported
   as `DONE` or `FAILED`
3. If `DONE`, the exported data will be available to download at the `download_url`
   included in the job status info.
4. If `FAILED`, the job status object will contain metadata describing what went wrong.

### Multiprocessing

The `bitdotio` SDK object is not safe to share between multiple processes. If you are
programming in a multiprocess environment, ensure that a `bitdotio` SDK object is
created per-process, not pre-fork.

# `bit` CLI

Installing the `bitdotio` module also installs the command line tool `bit` which lets
you interact with bit.io from scripts or the command line. This is installed next to
your python binary.

You'll want to grab your API key from your bit.io account - to get the key, log into to
bit.io, go to any database, and retrieve it from the "Connect" tab.

```
Usage: bit [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -k, --key TEXT  Your bit.io API key, available when you click the connect
                  button in bit.io
  --help          Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  db
  query
```

All of the commands return JSON.

You can supply your API key either via the `-k/--key` argument, or by setting the it to
the `BITIO_KEY` environment variable. The latter option keeps the key from showing up
in, eg, a `ps` command, and allows secret injection for systems like Kubernetes.


### Examples

#### List databases
```sh
BITIO_KEY=<your key> bit db list
```

This is the same as:

```sh
bit -k <your-key> db list
```

#### Run a query
```sh
bit -k <your-key> query -d "username/dbname" -q "SELECT * FROM my_table"
```
