    Parameters
    ----------
    freqs : array-like
        Frequencies at which to set the crossovers.
    order : array-like
        Order of the crossovers. The higher, the steeper.
    sampling_rate_hz : int, optional
        Sampling rate for the filterbank. Default: 48000.

    Returns
    -------
    fb : LRFilterBank
        Filter bank in form of LRFilterBank class which contains the same
        methods as the FilterBank class but is generated with different
        internal methods.

    bank. This implementation is taken from the pyfar package.
    See references for more information about it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_fractions : int, optional
        Octave fraction, e.g., ``3`` for third-octave bands. The default is
        ``1``.
    frequency_range : tuple, optional
        Frequency range for fractional octave in Hz. The default is
        ``(63, 16000)``
    overlap : float
        Band overlap of the filter slopes between 0 and 1. Smaller values yield
        wider pass-bands and steeper filter slopes. The default is ``1``.
    slope : int, optional
        Number > 0 that defines the width and steepness of the filter slopes.
        Larger values yield wider pass-bands and steeper filter slopes. The
        default is ``0``.
    n_samples : int, optional
        Length of the filter in samples. Longer filters yield more exact
        filters. The default is ``2**12``.
    sampling_rate : int
        Sampling frequency in Hz. The default is ``None``. Only required if
        ``signal=None``.

    Returns
    -------
    signal : Signal
        The filtered signal. Only returned if ``sampling_rate = None``.
    filter : FilterFIR
        FIR Filter object. Only returned if ``signal = None``.
    frequencies : np.ndarray
        Center frequencies of the filters.
