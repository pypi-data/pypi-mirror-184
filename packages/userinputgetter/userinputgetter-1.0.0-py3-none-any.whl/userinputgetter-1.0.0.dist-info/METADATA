# UserInputGetter

This package provides an interface, and several implementations, of classes which continuously request command-line user input until a valid response has been attained, and parse the output as a desired type.

The input is checked for validity (for example if a date is expected, the input must match one of several supported date regular expressions), and optionally a user may specified an iterable of supported options, in which case the user input must be parsable as one of the specified options.

The implementations provide two main methods for interacting with user input. The first is `get_value()`, and the second is `get_multiple_values()`, which parses multiple user inputs when provided as a comma-separated list

The abstract base class is called `UserInputGetter`, and the following implementations are provided:

## Implementations

* `IntegerInputGetter`
* `CaseInsensitiveStringInputGetter`
* `DateInputGetter`
