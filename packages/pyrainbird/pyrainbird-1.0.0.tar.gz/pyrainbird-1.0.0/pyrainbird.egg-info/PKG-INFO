# pyrainbird

Python module for interacting with [WiFi LNK](https://www.rainbird.com/products/module-wi-fi-lnk) module of the Rain Bird Irrigation system. This project has no affiliation with Rain Bird.

This module communicates directly towards the IP Address of the WiFi module. You can start/stop the irrigation, get the currently active zone, and other controller settings. This library currently only has very limited cloud support.

See [examples](examples/) for additional details on how to use the APIs.
