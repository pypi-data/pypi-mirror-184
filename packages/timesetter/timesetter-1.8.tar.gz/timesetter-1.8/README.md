# User Guide

Timesetter is a Python package to set system time regardless of operating system

## Supported Platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## Tips

- This package aims to set system time in the precision of below milliseconds.
- You need to pass a datetime object to the `set` function. If the timezone information was not included in the time object(naive), the package will assume that it's identical to the system.
- You need to run your Python code with administration privileges for this package to work properly. Otherwise, `PermissionError` will be raised. This applies to all platforms.

## How to Use

Install the package from PyPI

```
pip install timesetter
```

Then import it in your Python code

```
from datetime import datetime
import timesetter

target_time = datetime(year=2021, month=3, day=29, hour=15, minute=38, second=12)
timesetter.set(target_time)
```

# For Maintainers

## Rules

Type hints as well as stub files for Python should be provided for the maintainability of the code. Turn on strict type checking in whatever IDE you are using. If some third party packages doesn't support type checking very well, then you can write `# type: ignore` to suppress the warning.

## Command Line Scripts

Install packages written in `requirements.txt` from PyPI

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Generate the distribution archive to `/dist`

```
python -m build
```

Upload the package to PYPI

```
python -m twine upload dist/*
