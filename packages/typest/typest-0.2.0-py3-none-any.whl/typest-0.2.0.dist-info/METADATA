# typest

An experimental framework to test your library against type checkers, allowing
to formulate type expectations and expected typechecker errors. Its purpose is
the same as the one of
[pytest-mypy-plugins](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mypy-plugins/). While
`pytest-mypy-plugins` requires `.yaml` files for specifying the tests, `typest`
test cases are python files, expectations are formulated in comments:


```Python
from mylibrary import some_function

result = some_function()

reveal_type(result)  # expect-type: int
```


Besides expressing type expectations, you can also specify to expect an error
from the typechecker:

```Python
string: str = "not a number"
number: int = string  # expect-error
```


You can also specify which error you expect:

```Python
string: str = "not a number"
number: int = string  # expect-error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "int", variable has type "str")  [assignment]
```

## Installation

`typest` is available at pypi. You can install it through pip:

    pip install typest


## Use

    python -m typest [PATH]

If PATH is a directory, all python files under that directory (including
subdirectories) are going to be checked. If PATH points to a file, it has to be
a python file. If PATH is not provided, the directory from where the script is
called is being used.
