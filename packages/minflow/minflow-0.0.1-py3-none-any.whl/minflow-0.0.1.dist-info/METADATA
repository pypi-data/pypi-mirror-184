# MINFLOW - A customizable workflow for QE and ABINIT runs
This package was developed to make some custom DFT calculations using Quantum Espresso and ABINIT in a way
that was customized for the jobs and environments I had to run. This will be gradually made more tailored
and simple to use in further updates.
