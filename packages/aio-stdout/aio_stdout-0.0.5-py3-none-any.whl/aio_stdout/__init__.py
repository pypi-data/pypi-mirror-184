The purpose of this package is to provide asynchronous variants of
the builtin `input` and `print` functions. `print` is known to be
relatively slow compared to other operations. `input` is even slower
because it has to wait for user input. While these slow IO
operations are being ran, code using `asyncio` should be able to
continuously run.

ainput and aprint
------------------

With `aio_stdout`, the `aio_stdout.ainput` and `aio_stdout.aprint`
functions provide easy to use functionality with organized behaviour.

```python
import asyncio
from aio_stdout import ainput, aprint

async def countdown(n: int) -> None:
    """Count down from `n`, taking `n` seconds to run."""
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        await aprint(i)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def get_name() -> str:
    """Ask the user for their name."""
    name = await ainput("What is your name? ")
    await aprint(f"Your name is {name}.")
    return name

async def main() -> None:
    await asyncio.gather(countdown(15), get_name())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Example output:

```
15
What is your name? Jane
14
13
12
11
10
9
8
Your name is Jane.
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

Notice that while the prompt `"What is your name? "` is being waited
for, the `countdown` continues to `aprint` in the background, without
becoming blocked. The `countdown` does not, however, display its
results until the `ainput` is completed. Instead it waits for the
`ainput` to finish before flushing out all of the queued messages.

It is worth noting that with naive threading, a normal attempt to use
`print` while waiting on an `input` leads to overlapping messages.
Fixing this behavior requires a lot more work than should be needed
to use a simple `print` or `input` function, which is why this
package exists. To remedy this problem, queues are used to store
messages until they are ready to be printed. 

IO Locks
---------

Although the asynchronization behaviors of `ainput` and `aprint` are
nice, sometimes we want to be able to synchronize our messages even
more. IO locks provide a way to group messages together, locking the
global `aio_stdout` queues until it finishes or yields access.

```python
import asyncio
from aio_stdout import IOLock, ainput, aprint

async def countdown(n: int) -> None:
    """Count down from `n`, taking `n` seconds to run."""
    async with IOLock(n=5) as lock:
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            await lock.aprint(i)
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def get_name() -> str:
    """Ask the user for their name."""
    async with IOLock() as lock:
        name = await lock.ainput("What is your name? ")
        await lock.aprint(f"Your name is {name}.")
    return name

async def main() -> None:
    await asyncio.gather(countdown(15), get_name())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Let's try the example again now using the new locks:

```
15
14
13
12
11
What is your name? Jane
Your name is Jane.
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

Notice that this time the `countdown` does not immediately yield to
the `get_name`. Instead, it runs 5 messages before yielding control
over to `get_name`. Now, after the `lock.ainput` finishes, it does not
yield to `countdown`. Instead, it runs its own `lock.aprint` first. In
the meantime, `countdown` continues to run in the background and flushes
all of its buffered messages afterwards.

Flushing
---------

Since messages may be delayed, it is possible for your asynchronous
code to finish running before all messages are displayed, producing
confusing results. As such, the best recommended practice is to flush
from `main` before terminating.

```python
from aio_stdout import flush

@flush
async def main() -> None:
    ...
```

Final Example
-------------

Combining all best practices, the final example should look something
like this:

```python
import asyncio
from aio_stdout import IOLock, ainput, aprint, flush

async def countdown(n: int) -> None:
    """Count down from `n`, taking `n` seconds to run."""
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        await aprint(i)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def get_name() -> str:
    """Ask the user for their name."""
    async with IOLock() as lock:
        name = await lock.ainput("What is your name? ")
        await lock.aprint(f"Your name is {name}.")
    return name

@flush
async def main() -> None:
    await asyncio.gather(countdown(15), get_name())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Common Gotchas
---------------

- Using `input` or `print` instead of `ainput` and `aprint` will push
  a message immediately to the console, potentially conflicting with
  `ainput` or `aprint`.
- Using `ainput` or `aprint` instead of `lock.ainput` and
  `lock.aprint` may produce **deadlock** due to having to
  wait for the lock to release. As such, the `lock` is equipped
  with a default `timeout` limit of 10 seconds to avoid deadlock
  and explain to users this potential problem.
