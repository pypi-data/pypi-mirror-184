        <footnote id="F1">The reported securities are owned directly by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of
            Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire"). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of such subsidiary listed
            above, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of
            Common Stock presently directly owned by such subsidiary. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder
            of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary
            interest in, the shares of Common Stock presently owned by such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial
            ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.
