# typed-lists
`typed-lists` is a library for typed, parallelized lists for Python implemented in Rust. See `example.ipynb` for usage. The project is still pre-release.

The project heavily depends on [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) and PyO3 [`pyo3`](https://github.com/PyO3) and takes inspiration from `numpy`, Rust's `ndarray`, and many more packages.
