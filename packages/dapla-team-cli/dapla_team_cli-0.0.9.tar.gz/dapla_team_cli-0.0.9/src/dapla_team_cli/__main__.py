"""Command-line interface.

CLI commands are generally structured according to this convention:
<root> <command-group> <command>

Example:
    Given the command ´dpteam tf iam-bindings´ then...
    ´dpteam´ is the root (CLI name)
    ´tf´ is the command group and
    ´iam-bindings´ is the actual command

Command groups must be mounted here to become available.

Each sub-command's modules should be grouped into a separate python package.
