# ProofUtils ✨

`📝 Information:`

An easy-to-use package used for generating **fake nitro gifting proof** and other proofs for Discord. You are able to create bots with this package and use them for fake nitro and robux servers on Discord as a "**Discord Nitro Proof Bot**". 🤖

It uses **[HTML2Image](https://htmlcsstoimage.com/)** to return an image of your nitro gifting proof and **[this](https://github.com/itschasa/Discord-Scraped)** repository to fetch random avatars.

`📥 Installation:`

You are able to **install** the package directly through **[pip](https://pypi.org/project/proofutils/)** using the following command:

```
pip install proofutils
```

**Note:** Make sure you've downloaded the **[CSS files](https://github.com/ercenterprises/ProofUtils/tree/main/proofutils)** or you will receive errors! Place them in the same directory.

*Then simply import the package and use it as you wish.*

`🚫 Warning:`

**In order for it to work properly,** you must have **[these](https://github.com/ercenterprises/ProofUtils/tree/main/proofutils)** 2 CSS files installed in the same directory.

`💻 Usage:`

The **following** code is an example of how you could use the package using **[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)**.

```py
async def proof(interaction: discord.Interaction, type: app_commands.Choice[int], receiver_username: str, question: str, response: str):
  await interaction.response.defer(thinking=True)
  proof = ProofUtils(sender_username=interaction.user.name, sender_avatar=interaction.user.avatar.url, receiver_username=receiver_username, messages=[question, response], nitro_type=type.value).generate()
  await interaction.channel.send(content=f"Your Proof: <@{interaction.user.id}>", files=[discord.File(proof, "proof.png")])
```

`👨‍💻 Example:`

Here's a simple example of using ProofUtils.

```py
from proofutils import ProofUtils

generator = ProofUtils(sender_username="Derick", sender_avatar="https://discord.com/assets/7c8f476123d28d103efe381543274c25.png", receiver_username="Hey", messages=["Can I have my nitro?\nPlease!", "Thanks!"])
generator.generate() # Returns an image of your proof in bytes (io.BytesIO)
```
