# Flatiron Institute Fast Multipole Libraries
[![Actions status](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/FMM3D/workflows/Python%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/FMM3D/actions)

This codebase is a set of libraries to compute N-body interactions
governed by the Laplace and Helmholtz equations, to a specified
precision, in three dimensions, on a multi-core shared-memory machine.

Please see the [online documentation](https://fmm3d.readthedocs.io),
or its equivalent [user manual](fmm3d_manual.pdf).
