## Intro
Snort rule tokenizer and parser written using PLY. This is my first tokenizer, parser and I may make improvements as time goes on. I plan to test it more but it seems to be roughly working and I will release it so it can be tested more. If you have any suggestions, or improvements feel free to open an issue. Inspiration drawn from plyara.
