# Overview

`nexport` is a lightweight `python 3` package which enables neural network developers to export the weights and biases of trained networks to useful file types.

# Install & use

1. From terminal:
`pip install nexport`
2. From python environment:
`import nexport`

## Test

1. Clone repository:
`git clone https://github.com/JordanWelsman/nexport.git`
2. Build module for testing:
`python3 setup.py bdist_wheel`
3. Install module locally:
`pip install -e .`
4. Run tests with `PyTest`:
`pytest`

## Build

1. Build module for distribution:
`python3 setup.py bdist_wheel sdist`
2. Push to `PyPI`:
`pip install twine`
`twine upload dist/*`

# Objectives

- Export weights and biases to human-readable file
- Ensure compatability with all popular neural network development software

## Personal objectives

- Learn `PyTorch`
- Understand how `PyTorch` and `Keras` construct neural networks
- Learn how to publish a python package
- Create a pseudo-pipeline between `Python` and `Fortran` projects (`PyTorch`-`nexport`-`inference-engine`)
- Write a paper on this software

# History

This package is intended to be used in conjunction with [inference-engine](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/inference-engine). As such, `nexport` was developed by the `inference-engine` developers to enable compatability between the two softwares. `nexport` does this by exporting the weights and biases from networks compiled in `PyTorch`, `Keras`, and `TensorFlow` into standardized human-readable files. These files can be read by `inference-engine` to instantiate the netwoks in Fortran 2018 for inference.
