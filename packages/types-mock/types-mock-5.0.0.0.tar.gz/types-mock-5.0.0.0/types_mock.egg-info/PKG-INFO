## Typing stubs for mock

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `mock` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `mock`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/mock. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `8365b1aaefd46d506ca0dfe73e9721da2d03c566`.
