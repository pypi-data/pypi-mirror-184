# KECCEL MESSAGING

DR Congo at a very affordable cost. Both requests and responses are transmitted in JSON format.

Example Request

```json
{
 "token":"84hbYi6TU8Zu",
 "to":"243851234567",
 "from":"GUEST",
 "message":"Hello World"
}
```

Response Delivery Report

```json
{
 "status": "SENT",
 "messageID": "123456",
 "description": "Message submitted to the network"
}
```

## DELIVERY REPORTS
This service allows you to receive the delivery status of a previous sent message. There is NO delivery report for rejected
messages. The delivery can be automatically sent to your callback (PUSH) or you can retrieve it (PULL) from our server.

### PUSH: Automatic Delivery
If the Delivery Reports (DLR) are required, you need to provide a callback URL where an automatic HTTP request will be
sent with the previous messageID and the delivery status of the message (DELIVERED or FAILED).
The DLR receipt will be sent to your URL as below:
http(s)://yourcallbackurl?messageID=123456&status=DELIVERED

### PULL: Delivery Check
You can also send a request to our delivery endpoint to check on the delivery status of a previous sent message:
