# What is this?
This is a tool for managing latex templates. 

# Dependencies
The default latex engine is [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html). This can however be altered by editing the commands in the '.blatex' file in the root directory (this file is generated when initializin the project).

# Getting Started

Run `blatex init` in any directory. This is now root of your latex project. If the directory is empty, you will be prompted to use a template.

Compile the document by running `blatex compile`.
