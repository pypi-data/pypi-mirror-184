# Pii Extractor

This repository builds a Python package that performs PII detection for text
data i.e. extraction of PII (Personally Identifiable Information aka Personal
Data) items existing in the text.

The PII Tasks in the package are structured by language & country, since many
of the PII elements are language- and/or -country dependent.

## Requirements

The package 
 * needs at least Python 3.8
 * needs the pii-data base package
 * uses the python-stdnum package to validate identifiers, and needs the 

## Usage

The package can be used:
 * As an API, in two flavors: function-based API and object-based API
 * As a command-line tool

For details, see the usage document.


## Building

The provided Makefile can be used to process the package:
 * `make pkg` will build the Python package, creating a file that can be
   installed with `pip`
 * `make unit` will launch all unit tests (using pytest, so pytest must be
   available)
 * `make install` will install the package in a Python virtualenv. The
   virtualenv will be chosen as, in this order:
     - the one defined in the `VENV` environment variable, if it is defined
     - if there is a virtualenv activated in the shell, it will be used
     - otherwise, a default is chosen as `/opt/venv/bigscience` (it will be
       created if it does not exist)
