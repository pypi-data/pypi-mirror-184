   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to JSGF Grammar Tools's documentation!
==============================================

This set of tools is intended to aid the manipulation of 
JSGF Grammars. It includes a parser, and two string generators which
can be used to create artificial corpora. Some additional tools that will
be added in the near future include a tool to check grammars for recursion
and a tool to calculate the total number of strings a grammar generates.
