Source: https://goshippo.com/blog/measure-real-size-any-python-object/ The
get_size function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes and links in the graph. This is
because the function traverses the entire graph, visiting each node and link once.

The space complexity of the get_size function is also O(n), because the function stores a list of seen objects in the
seen parameter, which can grow up to the size of the graph.

In general, the time and space complexity of the get_size function is determined by the size of the graph,
rather than the number of attributes associated with the nodes or links. This is because the function only needs to
visit each node and link once, regardless of how many attributes they have.
