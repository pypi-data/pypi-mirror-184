        Many parameters are similar to those of BaseDecisionTree of sklearn.

        Parameters
        ----------
        criterion : {'policy_reg'}, default to 'policy_reg' # TODO: may add more criterion
            The function to measure the quality of a split. The criterion for
            training the tree is (in the Einstein notation)
                    S = \sum_i g_{ik} y^k_{i},
            where g_{ik} = \phi(v_i)_k is a map from the covariates, v_i, to a
            basis vector which has only one nonzero element in the R^k space. By
            using this criterion, the aim of the model is to find the index of the
            treatment which will render the max causal effect, i.e., finding the
            optimal policy.

        splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
            The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
            strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
            the best random split.

        max_depth : int, default=None
            The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
            all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
            min_samples_split samples.

        min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
            The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
            - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
            - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
            `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
            number of samples for each split.

        min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
            The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
            A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
            least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
            right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
            especially in regression.
            - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
            - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
            `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
            number of samples for each node.

        min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
            The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
            the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
            equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

        max_features : int, float or {"sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
            The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
            - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
            - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
            `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
            split.
            - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
            - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
            - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        random_state : int
            Controls the randomness of the estimator.

        max_leaf_nodes : int, default to None
            Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
            Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
            If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

        min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
            A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
            greater than or equal to this value.
            The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::
                N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                    - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
            where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
            samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
            left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.
            ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
            if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default to 0.0
            Value for pruning the tree. #TODO: not implemented yet.

            impurity, threshold and value attributes of each node.

        ax : matplotlib axis, default=None
            Axes to plot to. If None, use current axis. Any previous content
            is cleared.
