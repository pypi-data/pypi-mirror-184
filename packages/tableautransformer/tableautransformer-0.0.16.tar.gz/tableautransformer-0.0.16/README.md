# TableauTransformer

ETL tooling for preparing tableau seed data

## Description

This library was built with the intentions of enhancing the experience of data wrangling for tableau.
Tableau can be very particular about the data it reads from.
In addition preparing data to fit the shape for different graphs can be time consuming.
TableauTransformer can be used to hurdle over these two barriers.
